                <h2 class="font-bold">The main question:</h2>
                <div>Does salt water boil faster or slower than regular water?</div>

                <h2 class="font-bold">Preparations:</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>1 kilo of plain tap water was placed into the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>A separate kilo of plain tap water was mixed with 200g of regular table salt. The resulting salt water was weighted and showed a weight of exactly 1200g. Liquid was subtracted until the weight was exactly 1 kilo. This remaining kilo of salt water, which should be around 16.6% salt,  was put into the refrigerator.</li>
                    <li>Both liquids eventually reached a temperature of 8.5°C.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="font-bold">Conduction of the experiment:</h2>
                <div>The plain tap water was put into a regular iron pot and placed on the stove. A cooking thermometer was placed into the pot. The stove was then turned on to maximum heat while a camera was recording. The switching on of the stove produces a audible clicking sound. This sound was used as a t=0 for this experiment and allowed for relatively precise time measurement of time when evaluating the recorded video. Once the water remained at a roling boil with no visible changes occurring, the recording was ended.</div>
                <div>The stove was given enough time to fully return to room temperature. The same procedure was repeated, except with the prepared salt water.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="pb-8">
                <h2 class="font-bold">Result:</h2>
                <div>For several minutes no obvious difference in water appearance was visible, although the cooking thermometer showed a difference in degrees celsius.</div>
                <div class="p-3">
                    <div>Video that starts once differences start to develop: <a class="font-bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usloVW9oDNI" target="_blank">here</a></div>
                    <div>Full video: <a class="font-bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHSauLBsWkQ" target="_blank">here</a></div>
                </div>
                <div>As shown, the salt water boiled significantly faster than the regular water. The regular water reached a final temperature of around 99.5°C (according to the cooking thermometer). The salt water reached around 104°C. Meaning although the salt water has a higher boiling point, it boils faster.</div>

                <h2 class="font-bold">Side Notes:</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>The timer on the phone in the background was only an approximation during the experiment and will not match. The turning on sound of the stove was used to make sure the measurements start at the same moment.</li>
                    <li>Both the final cooking temperature of the regular water and the salt water were double-checked and the cooking thermometer was moved around to ensure the contact with the iron of the pot didn't influence the displayed temperature.</li>
                    <li>Room temperature remained relatively unchanged between the two experiments.</li>
                </ul>
